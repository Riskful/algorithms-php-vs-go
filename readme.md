Run code:

```make {algorithm-name}-{program-language}```

Example:
```make queue-php``` or ```make queue-go```

### List Data Structures:

* [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))
* [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))
* Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Hash Table
* Heap - max and min heap versions
* Priority Queue
* Trie
* Tree
    * Binary Search Tree
    * AVL Tree
    * Red-Black Tree
    * Segment Tree - with min/max/sum range queries examples
    * Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
* Graph (both directed and undirected)
* Disjoint Set
* Bloom Filter

### Algorithms

* **Math**
    * Bit Manipulation - set/get/update/clear bits, multiplication/division by two, make negative etc.
    * Binary Floating Point - binary representation of the floating-point numbers.
    * Fibonacci Number - classic and closed-form versions
    * Prime Factors - finding prime factors and counting them using Hardy-Ramanujan's theorem
    * Primality Test (trial division method)
    * Euclidean Algorithm - calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
    * Least Common Multiple (LCM)
    * Sieve of Eratosthenes - finding all prime numbers up to any given limit
    * Is Power of Two - check if the number is power of two (naive and bitwise algorithms)
    * Pascal's Triangle
    * Complex Number - complex numbers and basic operations with them
    * Radian & Degree - radians to degree and backwards conversion
    * Fast Powering
    * Horner's method - polynomial evaluation
    * Matrices - matrices and basic matrix operations (multiplication, transposition, etc.)
    * Euclidean Distance - distance between two points/vectors/matrices
    * Integer Partition
    * Square Root - Newton's method
    * Liu Hui π Algorithm - approximate π calculations based on N-gons
    * Discrete Fourier Transform - decompose a function of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up

### Algorithms by Paradigm

* ***Brute Force*** - look at all the possibilities and selects the best solution
    * Linear Search
    * Rain Terraces - trapping rain water problem
    * Recursive Staircase - count the number of ways to reach to the top
    * Maximum Subarray
    * Travelling Salesman Problem - shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city
    * Discrete Fourier Transform - decompose a function of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up
